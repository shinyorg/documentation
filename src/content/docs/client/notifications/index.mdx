import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="notifications" client:load />


You may ask "what does local notifications" have to do with device or background services?  Well.... turns out quite a bit.  You need a way
of letting your users know that you've done something in the background.  Maybe your job ran and determined that you need to do something OR you connected
to a BLE peripheral... who knows, but you'll definitely need local notifications at some point well using Shiny 


## iOS Specifics
There isn't anything specific to setting up local notifications on iOS.  However,
iOS has one specific rule - While the application  is running in the **FOREGROUND**, notifications will not be displayed.
You are responsible for notifying your users of actions happening while your app is running.  


## Android Specifics
Android has many different customization points - please review the [Android Specifics Documentation](xref:notifications-android)


# Notifications
First rule, as with any Shiny service.  Run RequestAccess

```csharp
var result = await ShinyHost.Resolve<INotificationManager>().RequestAccess();
if (result == PermissionState.Available) {
    // ... do something
}
```

using Shiny.Notifications;

public class NotificationDelegate : INotificationDelegate
{
    public async Task OnEntry(NotificationResponse response)
    {
    }
}

```

## Android Notification Entry

In order for Shiny to receive Android notification entries, you must add the following to your `MainActivity.cs` file

```csharp
using Android.App;
using Android.Content.PM;

namespace YourNamespace;

[Activity(
    Theme = "@style/Maui.SplashTheme",
    MainLauncher = true,
    ConfigurationChanges =
        ConfigChanges.ScreenSize |
        ConfigChanges.Orientation |
        ConfigChanges.UiMode |
        ConfigChanges.ScreenLayout |
        ConfigChanges.SmallestScreenSize |
        ConfigChanges.Density
)]
[IntentFilter(new[] {
    Shiny.ShinyNotificationIntents.NotificationClickAction
})]
public class MainActivity : MauiAppCompatActivity
{
}
```
