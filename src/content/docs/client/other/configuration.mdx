Configuration can be used without any other Shiny module.  It does not require the base Shiny hooks in order to function

## Features

* All the power of IConfiguration
* Load JSON from packaged sources (whitelabellers can unpack, edit, & repack the config)
* Preferences based configuration source with writebacks
* Environment variable based file name lookups (ie. appsettings.apple.debug.json)

## The Problem

Microsoft really did create a great set of abstractions for configuration.  You can store a set of key/values, cause a reload when a configuration source changes, & bind to strongly typed objects using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder. On Mobile though, NONE of the current providers aren't really well.

Why?
* A big feature for IConfiguration, is the ability to trigger a reload of it's source without restarting the application.  Changing an appsettings.json file during runtime causes the IConfiguration to trigger a reload notification. 
* Mobile doesn't really have an appsettings.json.  Sure you could put this in an embedded resource, but than it is readonly at all times other than the build process... after that - it is locked in place
* Essentially, IConfiguration becomes a string based dictionary for all intents and purposes - pretty useless considering

## The Solution

How Shiny.Extensions.Configuration brings the power of IConfiguration to Mobile!
* A platform preferences configuration source which allows you to WRITE a value back using IConfiguration[key] = value;
* A whitelabellers dream - the ability to unpack, change a json config file, and repack without trigger a build by using proper platform directories to load up the JSON files while still having the power of a proper configuration library internally.

## Setup

### AppSettings JSON
<Steps>
1. Install the NuGet package <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Extensions.Configuration" label="Shiny.Extensions.Configuration" />

2. Create an appsettings.json file like you would in ASP.NET Core application in your HEAD project.
    :::caution[Android]
    place the file in: Assets.  Ensure the build action on the file is set to 'AndroidAsset'
    :::
    :::caution[iOS]
    place the file in the ROOT of your project.  Ensure the build action on the file is set to 'BundleResource'
    :::   

3. Configure your IConfiguration using the following code in your application startup code (ie. Xamarin.Forms App).
    ```csharp
    // store this in your dependency injection container OR static class
    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddJsonPlatformBundle("DEBUG") // NOTE: you can change the name of appsettings.json to something else and pass as an argument here
        .Build();
    ```
</Steps>

4. Lastly, appsettings.json also automatically looks for the platform specific appsettings file and overrides/merges the values with the rest of the IConfiguration set.

   The [platform] can be ios, maccatalyst, apple (both ios & maccatalyst), or android
   This is the general naming convention we follow is `appsettings.[platform].[environment].json`

   The priority of files in the merge for iOS/Catalyst are:
    * appsettings.ios.[environment].json (or maccatalyst)
    * appsettings.ios.json (or maccatalyst)
    * appsettings.apple.[environment].json
    * appsettings.apple.json
    * appsettings.[platform].json
    * appsettings.json

    And for Android:
    * appsettings.android.[environment].json
    * appsettings.android.json
    * appsettings.json

    If the file(s) don't exist, they are simply skipped

### Preferences Provider

This provider allows writes and persists across application restarts.  It is a wrapper around the Android/iOS shared preferences.

<Steps>
1. Install the NuGet package <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Extensions.Configuration" label="Shiny.Extensions.Configuration" />
2. For this configuration source, nothing special is required, simply add the following to the configuration builder:

    ```csharp
    var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddPlatformPreferences()
        .Build();
    ```

    :::note
    The platform preferences provider supports updates and change notifications
    :::

    ```csharp
    IConfiguration config = ...; // build
    config["key"] = "value"; // write - this will cause a persist to the platform prefs and also trigger Option reloated events
    ```
</Steps>
