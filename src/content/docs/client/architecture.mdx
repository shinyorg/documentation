:::note[Why does Shiny use delegates instead of .NET based events?]
For several reasons... the first ensures that all necessary services are hooked when they need to be.  The second, events 
were often hooked at the wrong time (after they had fired).  The last, by ensuring a standard pattern, all services are ready can also 
be consumed by the delegate at the right time.  Delegates also apply a nice clean piece of code to unit test.

:::note[Why does Shiny have it's own platform lifecycles - why not just use what's built into MAUI?]
Because Shiny is not dependent on MAUI.  Shiny is built to move into the ever changing .NET client world.  Whether we go to MAUI, 
classic Xamarin, Uno, Blazor, etc - we want to ensure a path is open

:::note[Why does Shiny uses Reactive Extensions?]
Observables are far more powerful and a little bit better at not leaking memory.
