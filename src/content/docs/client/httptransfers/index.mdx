import LibBuilder from '/src/components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started 

As developers, we often take internet connectivity and speed for granted.  Mobile phones are taking HUGE sized photos these days that can take quite some time to upload.

:::caution
HTTP Transfers do not work in an iOS Simulator
:::

## Features

- Background Uploads & Downloads on each platform
- Supports transfer filtering based on metered connections (iOS & UWP only at the moment)
- Event Based Metrics
    - Percentage Complete
    - Total Bytes Expected
    - Total Bytes Transferred
    - Transfer Speed (Bytes Per Second)
    - Estimated Completion Time

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="httptransfers" client:load />


## Background Delegate

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Shiny;

namespace YourNamespace;


public partial class MyHttpTransferDelegate : IHttpTransferDelegate
{

    public async Task OnError(HttpTransferRequest request, Exception ex) 
    {
    }

    public async Task OnCompleted(HttpTransferRequest request)
    {
    }
}

// in multitargeted solutions on Android, you can completely customize the foreground service notification
#if ANDROID
public partial class TestHttpTransferDelegate : IAndroidForegroundServiceDelegate
{
    public void Configure(AndroidX.Core.App.NotificationCompat.Builder builder)
    {
            builder
                .SetContentTitle("MyApp")
                .SetContentText("My App is sending images")
                .SetSmallIcon(Resource.Mipmap.youricon);
    }
}

#endif

```

:::note[Android Foreground Service]
Android creates a foreground service that stays live until all transfers are complete (or have errored out).

The foreground service will also turn off if you CancelAll or Cancel the last transfer
:::


## Creating a Transfer

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

await manager.Queue(new HttpTransferRequest(
    "your UNIQUE identifier",
    "http://yourserver.com/upload", 
    true, // is upload (true) or download (false)
    "local file path" // local file path to upload from or download to
));

```

## Canceling a Transfer or All Transfers

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

await manager.Cancel("Your Transfer ID");

// OR

await manager.CancelAll();
```

## Get All Pending Transfers

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

var yourRequests = await manager.GetTransfers();
```

## Foreground

### Sending Multipart Data & Headers along with transfer

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

await manager.Queue(new HttpTransferRequest(
    "Your Identifier",
    "https://yoururl.com",
    isUploadBoolean,
    "upload from or download to file path",
    Headers: new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { "Test", "Test" }
    },
    HttpContent: TransferHttpContent.FromJson(new { Text = "This is test JSON" });
));
```

### Watching All Transfers (Progress)

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

await manager.Queue(new HttpTransferRequest(
    "Your Identifier",
    "https://yoururl.com",
    isUploadBoolean,
    "upload from or download to file path",
    Headers: new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { "Test", "Test" }
    },
    HttpContent: TransferHttpContent.FromJson(new { Text = "This is test JSON" });
));
```

### Watching a Specific Transfer

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

var sub = manager.WatchTransfer("Your identifier string").Subscribe(
    x => 
    {
        // this fires as progress and state changes come in
        //x.Progress.PercentComplete
        //x.Progress.BytesPerSecond
    },
    ex => 
    {
        // fires when an error outside of connectivity issues occur
    },
    () =>
    {
        // fires when the transfer is complete
    }
);

// dispose of the subscription if you don't want to observe any longer or let it complete
sub.Dispose();

```

### Managed List

The managed list is meant manage a list of transfers that you can bind against in your UI.  It manages all of the progress 
updates, completions, and errors.  All you have to do is bind to the list and the models, it takes care of the rest.

* The list is managed in a thread safe manner
* As new transfers are added, the list is updated

```csharp
HttpTransferMonitor monitor; // inject, resolve, etc

// Using MVVM, you can bind to the following:
monitor.Transfers // (of type HttpTransferObject)

// now start the monitor
monitor.Start(
    bool removeFinished = true,
    bool removeErrors = true,
    IScheduler? scheduler = null
);

// after this, queuing or cancelling downloads will update list
```

The second part of this is binding to the `HttpTransferObject` which is also an MVVM based notify object.  Progress, state, & error changes will
all occur here.  Everything you need to inform users of their transfer progress is here:

```csharp
public class HttpTransferObject : NotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public string Identifier { get; }
    public string Uri { get; }
    public bool IsUpload { get; }
    public double PercentComplete { get; }
    public long BytesPerSecond { get; }
    public bool IsDeterministic { get; }
    public long? BytesToTransfer { get; }
    public long BytesTransferred { get; }
    public TimeSpan EstimatedTimeRemaining { get; }
    public HttpTransferState Status { get; }
}
```
