Title: Request Context
---

Do you want to get certain bits of contextual data without having to muck up your data?  For that matter, if you're using HTTP OpenApi generation, how would
you even do that?  Enter `Request Contexts`.  These are basically dictionaries of objects that allow middleware to set pieces of data you may be interested in.

Some Examples

* Is this data coming from the cache?  If so, when is it from?  
* Is this data coming from the offline store?  If so, when was it last updated?
* There was an error that user notification trapped, we displayed it to the user and logged it, but maybe I want to do a little more processing on that Exception

## How to use

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // injected
var response = mediator.RequestWithContext(myRequest, CancellationToken.None);

response.Result // your result
response.Context.

```
