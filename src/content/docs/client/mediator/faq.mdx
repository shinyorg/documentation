:::note[Why is there a Request & Send for requests]
`IRequest` basically is a void request.  `IRequest<TResult>` is a request that returns a result.  If module A changed from/to void from/to a result based
request, we wanted the compile to break for other consumers of your message.  Having different signatures was the best way to show this.

:::note[Configuration & Globs]
We allow `MyNamespace.*` or even further `*` which actually enables certain middleware to run on all requests handlers.  While configuration allows a far
easier and global way to work against handlers without throwing attributes all over your code.  However, with great power comes great responsibility.
