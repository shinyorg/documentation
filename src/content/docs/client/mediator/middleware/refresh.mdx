title: STREAMS - Refresh Timer

There are scenarios where you want to have data requests be called every so often. The `RefreshTimer` middleware is designed to help you with this.

```csharp
[RefreshTimer(3000)] // every 3 seconds
public class MyStreamRequestHandler : IStreamRequestHandler<MyRequest, string>
{
    public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> Handle(MyRequest request, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        yield return DateTimeOffset.Now.ToString("h:mm:ss tt");
    }
} 
```

:::note
Refresh timer middleware is installed by the main Shiny.Mediator package by default
:::

:::warning
Use this in focused areas without something like cache and offline on top of the request.
