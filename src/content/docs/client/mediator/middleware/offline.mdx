# Offline Availability

* Have you ever found a case where you have a cache, but it just doesn't care about the user's current network status?  
* Have you ever wanted to ensure data is available for your app the next time it launches, but the user is disconnected?

When you are building a mobile app, you need to consider offline availability.  This is especially true for apps that
are used in the field or in areas where network connectivity is spotty.  

:::note
Offline availability is installed by default with the UseMaui setup.

The offline availability middleware is used as part of the default middleware installed by Shiny.Mediator.Maui.  Like most
other middleware, you simply need to mark your IRequestHandler.Handle method(s) with the attribute `[Offline]`

The offline attribute also takes a boolean - true = keep the response across app restarts, false = only keep the response in meory with the current app session.

Obviously, offline only works for request handlers with a return value.

Fine grained control over offline data is available via [Request Keys](../requestkeys)
:::

## Request Handler Example

```csharp
public class MyRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<MyRequest, IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>>
{
    [OfflineAvailable]
    public async Task<IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>> Handle(MyRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // each return will overwrite the previous return value
    }
}
```

:::note
Above is configured with the `OfflineAvailableAttribute`.  You can also configure the Microsoft Extensions Configuration using the following:

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "Offline": {
            "MyNamespace.SomeHttpRequest": true
        }
    }
}
```

For more info about configuration, see [Middleware Configuration](./)

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use Offline. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

## Controlling HOW the offline data is stored

Often, there are times you want to store data based on the parameter arguments within your request.  Trying to build these keys for you
can be a bit tricky, so we have a simple interface to help you out instead.

The offline middleware looks at your IRequest implementation.  You can also implement the `IRequestKey` interface which is part
of the Shiny.Mediator.Contracts library.  This allows you to 'build' a key from possible arguments in your request object.

Example
```csharp
public record MyRequest(string Arg1, int Arg2) : IRequest<IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>>, IRequestKey
{
    public string GetKey() => $"{this.Arg1}-{this.Arg2}";
}
```
