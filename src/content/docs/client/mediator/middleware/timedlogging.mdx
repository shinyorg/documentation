Ever wanted to track and log how long your requests take to process?  Maybe even have an error logged if a call is passing
a certain threshold? The `TimedLogging` middleware is designed to help you with this.

Internally, the middleware will log the time it takes to process a request to your logging setup.  If the error threshold is passed, it
will log an error otherwise it will log to Debug.

:::warning
We recommend focusing timed logging on your most critical requests.  Logging every request can be a performance hit.

## Setup

In your host startup, add the following to your mediator configuration:

```csharp 
services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseTimedLogging());
```

:::note
Timed middleware is part of the Shiny.Mediator.Maui package and is installed by default with the `UseMaui` setup.
:::

To use it on with your request handlers, simply mark them with the `TimedLoggingAttribute`:

```csharp
public class MyRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<MyRequest>
{
    [TimedLogging(3000)] // If longer than 3000 milliseconds, log as an error
    public async Task Execute(MyRequest request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // do your work
    }
} 
```
