Ever wanted to track and log how long your requests take to process?  Maybe even have an error logged if a call is passing
a certain threshold? The `TimedLogging` middleware is designed to help you with this.


:::warning
We recommend focusing timed logging on your most critical requests.  Logging every request can be a performance hit.
