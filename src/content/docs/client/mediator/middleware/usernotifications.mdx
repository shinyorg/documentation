title: REQUEST - User Notification Exception Handling
---
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import NugetBadge from '../../../../../components/NugetBadge.tsx';

User notification exception handling is great for scenarios where the user initiates an action, but an issue occurs
such as the network failing, data issues, etc.  This middleware does the standard try/execute/catch/log & notify user
that something went wrong

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with Shiny.Mediator.Maui
