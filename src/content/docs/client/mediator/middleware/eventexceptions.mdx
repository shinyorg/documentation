# Exception Handling

Events can throw exceptions.  You can trap them at a global level by awaiting the Publish call.  However, there may be cases
where you may want other events to complete and not be blocked by one misbehaving piece of code.  Thus, we have middleware to help
deal with this in a very simple/straight forward manor.  

This middleware does nothing more than log an error and `moves on`.  This is applied to all event handlers and does not require any attributes
or configuration like other middleware

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with Shiny.Mediator
