# Requests

Requests are really the center of all the action in the Mediator.  Request can only be fulfilled/responded to by a single handler.  Requests also have
the ability to respond with a result as well.

:::warning
When issuing a request, we start a fresh Service Provider scope.  This means that any dependencies that are registered as `Scoped` will be disposed of after the request is completed.  If you need to maintain a dependency, you should register it as `Singleton`
:::

## Creating Requests

A request can be a class, record, or struct.  It must implement the `IRequest` interface.  If you want to return a result, then you must implement `IRequest<TResult>`

```csharp
public record VoidRequest(string AnyArgs, int YouWant) : Shiny.Mediator.IRequest;

public record ResponseRequest : IRequest<Response>;
public record Response(string Anything);
```

The request handlers are also very similar

```csharp
public class VoidRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<VoidRequest>
{
    public async Task Handle(VoidRequest request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // do something async here
    }
}

public class ResponseRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<ResponseRequest, Response>
{
    public async Task<Response> Handle(ResponseRequest request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var response = await GetResponseThing(ct);
        return response;
    }
}

```
Now, let's register these guys through your host builder/DI container.  They can technically work off any lifecycle you choose.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IRequestHandler<VoidRequest>, VoidRequestHandler>();
services.AddSingleton<IRequestHandler<ResponseRequest, Response>, ResponseRequestHandler>();

// OR USING OUR EASY EXTENSION METHOD
services.AddSingletonAsImplementedInterfaces<VoidRequestHandler>();
services.AddSingletonAsImplementedInterfaces<ResponseRequestHandler>();
```

Finally, let's send a request through the mediator

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // get from your DI container or inject into your DI aware component

await mediator.Send(new VoidRequest("Hello", 123));

var result = await mediator.Send(new ResponseRequest());
```

:::note
IMediator.Send is for `void` requests where no result is provided
IMediator.Request is for requests that provide a result.  This is to prevent future issues where the contract may change between a void & result which breaks the build intentionally to let consumers know of the change.

## Middleware

In our opinion, this is where Shiny Mediator really begins to shine.  Layering overtop of your requests with middleware is beautiful.  We offer some excellent `out of the box` middleware.  Be sure to check out it [here](/client/mediator/middleware/)

Middleware allows you to mutate the requests, response, or even short circuit the request.  It's a great place to do things like logging, error handling, caching, etc.

:::note
Middleware has a slight difference for void requests where the `TResult` is `void` and requests that return a result of Unit.
:::

Let's take a look at an sample piece of request middleware
```csharp
public delegate Task<TResult> RequestHandlerDelegate<TResult>();
public interface IRequestMiddleware<TRequest, TResult> where TRequest : IRequest<TResult>
{
    Task<TResult> Process(
        TRequest request, 
        RequestHandlerDelegate<TResult> next, 
        IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResult> requestHandler, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken
    );
}
```
