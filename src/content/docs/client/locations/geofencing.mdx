import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

Geofencing is a very battery efficient setup for most background applications.  While similar to GPS listeners, it operates

:::note[You can only register a maximum amount of geofence regions?]
- Android - 60
- iOS - 20
:::

:::caution
Testing Geofences in the Android emulator is difficult.  If you have Google Play Services installed, we try to use that mechanism.
However, this has issues with the emulator.  You cannot use the emulated position tool provided by the emulator without running something like Google Maps.
:::

## Features
* Fallback to standard GPS when Google Play Services is not available (please make sure to read [GPS documentation](./gps) for additional setup)

## Setup
<LibBuilder componentName="geofencing" client:load />


## Setup


### Creating a Background Listener (Delegate)


```csharp
public class MyGeofenceDelegate : Shiny.Locations.IGeofenceDelegate
{
    public Task OnStatusChanged(GeofenceState newStatus, GeofenceRegion region)
    {
        // do something here - iOS only gives you about 4 seconds to finish (plus whatever it took to initialize to get here)
    }
}
```
