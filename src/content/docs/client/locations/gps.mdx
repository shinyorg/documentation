import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started
Xamarin Essentials is great, but Shiny makes realtime background location updates a thing on Xamarin/MAUI based platform.

:::note
While Shiny is built to support background operations, GPS can work in strictly a foreground perspective by simply registering
```csharp
services.AddGps();
```
without any GPS delegate.
:::

## Setup
<LibBuilder componentName="gps" client:load />

## Starting/Stopping the GPS Service

```csharp
IGpsManager gpsManager; // injected, resolved, etc
await gpsManager.StartListener(new GpsRequest
{
    UseBackground = true
});

gpsManager.StopListening();
```


## Observing in the background

First, create the delegate that implements IGpsDelegate

```csharp
public partial class MyGpsDelegate : Shiny.Locations.IGpsDelegate 
{
    public MyGpsDelegate() 
    {
        // like all other shiny delegates, dependency injection works here
        // treat this as a singleton
    }


    public Task OnReading(IGpsReading reading)
    {
        // do something with the reading
    }
}
```

:::note
Pay attention to the partial on the delegate above. If you want some more control on the Android side of things, the partial will be needed for the additional
setup below

### Controlling GPS Notification on Android

```csharp
#if ANDROID
public partial class MyGpsDelegate : Shiny.IAndroidForegroundServiceDelegate 
{
    public void ConfigureNotification(AndroidX.Core.App.NotificationCompat.Builder builder)
    {
            builder
                .SetContentTitle("MyApp")
                .SetContentText("My App is following you!! images")
                .SetSmallIcon(Resource.Mipmap.youricon);
    }    
}
#endif
```

Next, let's register that with your app builder/hosting/service collection

```csharp
services.UseGps<MyGpsDelegate>();
```

Lastly, last start it up
```csharp
IGpsManager gpsManager; // injected, resolved, etc
await gpsManager.StartListener(new GpsRequest
{
    UseBackground = true
});
```

## Easier Delegate

The platform mechanics don't always play by the rules for time & distance filters that you may expect especially with a more 'real time' setup.  
To work around these issues, you can use the `GpsDelegate` class which will handle the filtering for you.

```sharp
public class MyGpsDelegate : GpsDelegate
{
    public MyGpsDelegate(ILogger<MyGpsDelegate> logger) : base(logger) 
    { 
        // if either of these filters pass, the OnReading method will be called
        this.MinimumDistance = Distance.FromMeters(200);
        this.MinimumTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
    }

    
    protected override async Task OnGpsReading(GpsReading reading)
    {
        
    }
}
```
