Shiny Mediator is something new I've been working on.  I love Jimmy Bogard's MediatR library on the server, but I just couldn't 
get it to fit the way I wanted for Apps... especially Blazor & .NET MAUI apps.  


What is a mediator? It's a small in-process version of a message bus.  MAUI has MessagingCenter, the Community toolkit has the weak message center, and Prism
offers an event aggregator.  They're all great, but they lack in areas that I want "more".

* If an event errors, the whole chain dies in the publish
* Events are fired in a foreach (mostly)
* You have to tie into them and unsubscribe from them or you can leak memory
* They don't provide the concept of command or request/response models (a command can only be responded to by a single handler) 
* They don't provide any sort of middleware (pre & post handling)

Sure - they aren't geared for these things, but the question is "what is"?

Some might say "this is overengineering" or "too complex". I would counter that comment by saying that this can actually simplify your architecture
overall by removing a lot of complex plumbing around 


# Out of the Box middleware

### (Request) Caching
Caching that watches things like connectivity.  

### (Request) Slow Execution Monitoring

### (Events) Main Thread Execution

### (Events) Error Handling
