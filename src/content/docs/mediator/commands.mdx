title: Commands
---


Commands are much like [Requests](/mediator/requests) but without the result.  Commands allow you to do things that Requests simply
can't do like deferred or scheduled execution.  You can still wait to make sure your command has been stored/executed/etc.

:::warning
When issuing a command, we start a fresh Service Provider scope.  This means that any dependencies that are registered as `Scoped` will be disposed of after the request is completed.  If you need to maintain a dependency, you should register it as `Singleton`
:::

## Creating Commands
A request can be a class, record, or struct.  It must implement the `IRequest` interface.  If you want to return a result, then you must implement `IRequest<TResult>`

```csharp
public record MyCommand(string RandomArg) : Shiny.Mediator.ICommand;
```

Now let's create our handler

```csharp

public class MyCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<MyCommand>
{
    public async Task Handle(MyCommand command, MediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // do something with the command
    }
}

```
Now, let's register these guys through your host builder/DI container.  They can technically work off any lifecycle you choose.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICommandHandler<MyCommand>, MyCommand>();

// OR USING OUR EASY EXTENSION METHOD
services.AddSingletonAsImplementedInterfaces<ResponseRequestHandler>();

```

Finally, let's send a request through the mediator

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // get from your DI container or inject into your DI aware component

var context = await mediator.Send(new MyCommand());
// note that you get back a context to receive back any metadata that may have been processed through by middleware or the handler
```

## Middleware

In our opinion, this is where Shiny Mediator really begins to shine.  Layering overtop of your requests with middleware is beautiful.  We offer some excellent `out of the box` middleware.  Be sure to check out it [here](/client/mediator/middleware/)

Middleware allows you to mutate the command or even [schedule it](./middleware/scheduling) for later execution.  It's a great place to do things like logging, error handling, caching, etc.

Let's take a look at an sample piece of request middleware that handles a specific use-case

```csharp

public class MyCommandMiddleware : ICommandMiddleware<MyCommand>
{
    public async Task Process(
        IMediatorContext context,
        CommandHandlerDelegate next,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken
    )
    {
        // do something before the request is handled
        await next();
        // do something after the request is handled
    }
}
```

Now, let's register this middleware with your host builder

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICommandMiddleware<MyCommand>, MyCommandMiddleware>();
```

Let's take a look a general purpose middleware that handles any command

```csharp
public class MyCommandMiddleware<TCommand>: ICommandMiddleware<TCommand> where TCommand : ICommand
{
    public async Task Process(
        IMediatorContext context,
        CommandHandlerDelegate next,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken
    )
    {
        // do something before the request is handled
        await next();
        // do something after the request is handled
    }
}
```

Make sure to register this middleware with your host builder using an open generic

```csharp
ServiceCollection services;

services.AddSingleton(typeof(ICommandMiddleware<>), typeof(MyCommandMiddleware<>));

// OR

services.AddMediator(x => 
{
    x.AddOpenCommandMiddleware(typeof(MyGeneralMiddleware<>));
});
```
