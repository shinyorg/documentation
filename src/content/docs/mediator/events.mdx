Event handlers are just like commands, but they are used to notify other parts of the application that something has happened.  
Events are not meant to return a value, but rather to notify other parts of the application that something has happened.

Shiny Mediator does a couple of other cool things that other Mediator libraries do not.  

* They support middleware, which allows you to intercept and modify events before they are processed.  This is useful for things like logging, error handling, and more.
* Event collectors allow you to publish events to other temporary sources such as a transient/scoped viewmodel attached to a .NET MAUI page or Blazor component that may not be registered with your dependency container.


Publishing events are done through the `IMediator` interface.  You can publish events in a fire-and-forget manner or wait for them to complete.

<Steps>

1. Just like with requests, let's setup our event and event handler
   ```csharp
   public class TestEvent : IEvent {}
   public class TestEventHandler : IEventHandler<TestEvent>
   {
       public Task Handle(TestEvent @event, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct) => Task.CompletedTask;
   }
   ```

2. Now let's publish our event

   ```csharp
   IMediator mediator; // get from your DI container or inject into your DI aware component

   await mediator.Publish(new TestEvent());
   ```

3. Don't want to wait around for all your events to finish.  We have an easy fire & forget set of methods.

   ```csharp
   mediator.Publish(new TestEvent()).RunInBackground(error => {});
   ```
</Steps>

:::note
Our current event publisher uses a Task.WhenAll mechanism to publish event meaning that events are invokved in parallel.  Order should not be a concern when publishing events.

## .NET MAUI

If your page or viewmodel implements the `IEventHandler` interface, it will automatically participate in the event chain.  If the page is popped off the navigation stack, it is no longer part of the event chain.

To add .NET MAUI support:

<Steps>

1. Install the <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Maui" showLabel={true} /> package
2. Now, in your `MauiProgram.cs`, alter the `AddShinyMediator` call

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseMaui());
    ```

    :::note
    UseMaui installs some standard middleware 

    * User Notification Exception Handling (Request)
    * Timed Measurement (Request)
    * Offline Availability (Request)
    * Replay (Request)
    * Replay (Stream)
    * Main Thread (Events)
    * Event Handling (Events)
    :::

</Steps>

## Blazor (& Blazor MAUI Hyrbid)

Blazor is a bit of a different beast vs .NET MAUI since their isn't a navigation stack, there is really only a single active page.  Any component in Blazor, can implement `IEventHandler` 
to catch an event.

<Steps>

1. Install the `Shiny.Mediator.Blazor` package


2. Now, in your `Startup.cs`, alter the `AddShinyMediator` call

    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseBlazor());
    ``` 
</Steps>

## Middleware

Event middleware is far simpler than request & streaming middleware due to no results being returned by the handler.  Like all other middleware,
covariance is supported so you can intercept a base event and modify it before it is processed.


Below is a super simple example of an exception handler middleware that uses convariance to work against all event types.

```csharp
public class ExceptionHandlerEventMiddleware<TEvent>(ILogger<TEvent> logger) : IEventMiddleware<TEvent> where TEvent : IEvent
{
    public async Task Process(IMediatorContext context, EventHandlerDelegate next, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        try
        {
            await next().ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.LogError(ex, $"Error in event {@event.GetType().FullName}");
        }
    }
}
```

To register an event like this:

```csharp
ServiceCollection service; // with your host builder or service collection

services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => 
{
    // NOTE: the open generic
    cfg.AddOpenEventMiddleware(typeof(ExceptionHandlerEventMiddleware<>));
});
```
