Requests are really the center of all the action in the Mediator.  Request can only be fulfilled/responded to by a single handler.  Requests also have
the ability to respond with a result as well.

:::warning
When issuing a request, we start a fresh Service Provider scope.  This means that any dependencies that are registered as `Scoped` will be disposed of after the request is completed.  If you need to maintain a dependency, you should register it as `Singleton`
:::

## Creating Requests

A request can be a class, record, or struct.  It must implement the `IRequest` interface.  If you want to return a result, then you must implement `IRequest<TResult>`

```csharp
public record ResponseRequest : Shiny.Mediator.IRequest<Response>;
public record Response(string Anything);
```

The request handlers are also very similar

```csharp

public class ResponseRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<ResponseRequest, Response>
{
    public async Task<Response> Handle(ResponseRequest request, RequestContext<ResponseRequest> context, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var response = await GetResponseThing(ct);
        return response;
    }
}

```
Now, let's register these guys through your host builder/DI container.  They can technically work off any lifecycle you choose.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IRequestHandler<ResponseRequest, Response>, ResponseRequestHandler>();

// OR USING OUR EASY EXTENSION METHOD
services.AddSingletonAsImplementedInterfaces<ResponseRequestHandler>();
```

Finally, let's send a request through the mediator

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // get from your DI container or inject into your DI aware component

var result = await mediator.Request(new ResponseRequest());
```

:::warning
If you use IMediator.Request and TResult implements IEvent, mediator will publish that event for you before returning to the request caller

## Middleware

In our opinion, this is where Shiny Mediator really begins to shine.  Layering overtop of your requests with middleware is beautiful.  We offer some excellent `out of the box` middleware.  Be sure to check out it [here](/client/mediator/middleware/)

Middleware allows you to mutate the requests, response, or even short circuit the request.  It's a great place to do things like logging, error handling, caching, etc.

Let's take a look at an sample piece of request middleware that handles a specific use-case

```csharp

public class MyRequestMiddleware : IRequestMiddleware<ResponseRequest, Response>
{
    public async Task<Response> Process(
        IMediatorContext context,
        RequestHandlerDelegate<Response> next,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken
    )
    {
        // do something before the request is handled
        var response = await next();
        // do something after the request is handled
        return response;
    }
}
```

Now, let's register this middleware with your host builder

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IRequestMiddleware<ResponseRequest, Response>, MyRequestMiddleware>();
```

Let's take a look a general purpose middleware that handles any request

```csharp
public class MyGeneralMiddleware<TRequest, TResult>: IRequestMiddleware<TResult, TResult>
{
    public async Task<TResult> Process(
        IMediatorContext context,
        RequestHandlerDelegate<TResult> next,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken
    )
    {
        // do something before the request is handled
        var result = await next();
        // do something after the request is handled

        return result;
    }
}
```

Make sure to register this middleware with your host builder using an open generic

```csharp
ServiceCollection services;

services.AddSingleton(typeof(IRequestMiddleware<,>), typeof(MyGeneralMiddleware<,>));

// OR

services.AddMediator(x => 
{
    x.AddOpenRequestMiddleware(typeof(MyGeneralMiddleware<,>));
});
```
