title: MAUI
---
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import NugetBadge from '/src/components/NugetBadge.tsx';

## Setup
1. Install <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Maui" showLabel={true} /> to your project.
2. In your MauiProgram.cs file, add the following:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseMaui());
```
3. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would 


## Event Collector
The MAUI event collector is installed by default by `UseMaui`.  Event collectors allow event handlers that may not be registered with dependency injection/Mediator
to still participate in `IMediator.Publish` calls.  The MAUI event collector will navigate the navigation stack, any page or viewmodel on that page that implements
the event handler type for the event contract can now participate in the subscription.


## Middleware Support
The Mediator MAUI extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseMaui`

* [Main Thread](/mediator/middleware/mainthread)
* [User Notification Errors](/mediator/exceptionhandlers)
* [Offline](/mediator/middleware/offline)
* [Replay Stream](/mediator/middleware/replay)
* [Persistent Caching](/mediator/middleware/caching)

## Connectivity Broadcaster
Connectivity is used on almost every page or viewmodel in an app.  You almost always have to inject the .NET MAUI IConnectivity service and hook the StateChanged event
to do things like disabling buttons, showing errors, or putting up an banner to let you users know why your app isn't showing fresh data.  That's a lot of extra
code, cleanup, hooks, etc.  This is where connectivity broadcaster comes in

```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.AddConnectivityBroadcaster());

// or Page
public class MyViewModel : Shiny.Mediator.IEventHandler<Shiny.Mediator.ConnectivityChanged>
{
    public async Task Handle(ConnectivityChanged @event, EventContext<ConnectivityChanged> context, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // that's it
        SomeString = @event.Connected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected";
    }        
}
```
