**Blazor** is a .NET frontend web framework that supports both server-side rendering and client interactivity in a single programming model


## Setup
1. Install <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Blazor" showLabel={true} /> to your project.
2. In your Program.cs file, add the following:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseMaui());
```
3. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would 


## Event Collector
The Blazor event collector is installed by default by `UseBlazor`.  Event collectors allow event handlers that may not be registered with dependency injection/Mediator
to still participate in `IMediator.Publish` calls. 


## Middleware Support
This extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseMaui`
