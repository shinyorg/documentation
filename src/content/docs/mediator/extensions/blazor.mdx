**Blazor** is a .NET frontend web framework that supports both server-side rendering and client interactivity in a single programming model


## Setup
1. Install <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Blazor" showLabel={true} /> to your project.
2. In your Program.cs file, add the following:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseMaui());
```
3. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would 


## Event Collector
The Blazor event collector is installed by default by `UseBlazor`.  Event collectors allow event handlers that may not be registered with dependency injection/Mediator
to still participate in `IMediator.Publish` calls. 


## Middleware Support
This extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseMaui`

* [User Notification Errors](/mediator/exceptionhandlers)
* [Offline](/mediator/middleware/offline)
* [Replay Stream](/mediator/middleware/replay)
* [Persistent Caching](/mediator/middleware/caching)

## Connectivity Broadcaster
Connectivity is used on almost every page or viewmodel in an app.  You almost always have to inject the a connectivity service and hook the StateChanged event
to do things like disabling buttons, showing errors, or putting up an banner to let you users know why your app isn't showing fresh data.  That's a lot of extra
code, cleanup, hooks, etc.  This is where connectivity broadcaster comes in

<Steps>
1. In your main lastout, add the `<InternetConnectivity />` component
   ```razor
   <MediatorInternetConnectivity />
   ```

   :::note
   This component also takes an optional child renderer fragment so you can add content when the value of `Connected` is false
   :::

2. In your pages, controls (in scope of current page), or services, implement the `IConnectivityEventHandler` interface
   ```csharp
   public class MyService : Shiny.Mediator.IConnectivityEventHandler
   {
    
       public async Task Handle(ConnectivityChanged @event, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
       {
           // that's it
           SomeString = @event.Connected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected";
       }        
   }
   ```

   OR

   ```razor
   @implements Shiny.Mediator.IConnectivityEventHandler
   @code {
        public async Task Handle(ConnectivityChanged @event, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            // that's it
            SomeString = @event.Connected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected";
            await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
        }
   }
   ```
</Steps>
