The **Uno Platform** is an [Open-source platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno) for building single codebase native mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps quickly.

* **Flexible:** Choose your **OS** (Windows, macOS, Linux), **IDE** (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider, Codespaces/Gitpod), state management, and design systems. Use only what works for you.
* **Productive:** Built-in **XAML & C# [Hot Reload](https://aka.platform.uno/hot-reload)** for Visual Studio, VS Code, and JetBrains Rider. Use **[Hot Design](https://aka.platform.uno/hot-design)**, a **real-time visual designer**, to edit UI instantly without restarting your app. Supports **[one-click Figma design exports](https://aka.platform.uno/Design-to-Code)**.
* **Rich:** Reuse **hundreds of .NET UI components** or first-party **native controls** for visually stunning apps.
* **Beautiful:** Deliver **pixel-perfect**, Material- or Fluent-themed apps across all platforms.

This innovative platform has become a powerhouse in the .NET ecosystem. 

With **Uno Platform + Mediator**, you can now take advantage of all our offline, persistent cache, and other app-building
middleware.

## Setup
1. Setup your environment first by following the [Get Started instructions](https://aka.platform.uno/get-started) for Uno Platform.
2. Create an Uno Platform project while following these [instructions](https://aka.platform.uno/vs-create-an-app).

   If youâ€™re upgrading an existing Uno Platform solution, refer to the [upgrading documentation](https://aka.platform.uno/migrate-from-previous) to ensure compatibility with the latest stable version.
3. Install <span style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Uno" showLabel={true} /></span> to your project.

    To do that you can use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio for example or manually:

    * Edit your project file `PROJECT_NAME.csproj` and add the reference:

        ```xml
        <ItemGroup>
            <PackageReference Include="Shiny.Mediator.Uno" />
        </ItemGroup>
        ```

    * Edit `Directory.Packages.props` and add the reference version:

        ```xml
        <ItemGroup>
            <PackageVersion Include="Shiny.Mediator.Uno" Version="3.3.1" />
        </ItemGroup>
        ```
4. In your `App.xaml.cs` file, add the following:
    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseUno());
    ```
5. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would.

## Middleware Support

The Mediator Uno Platform extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseUno`.
