The **Uno Platform** is an [Open-source platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno) for building single codebase native mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps quickly.

With **Uno Platform + Mediator**, you can now take advantage of all our offline, persistent cache, and other app-building
middleware.

Visit their [website](https://platform.uno/) and [documentation](https://aka.platform.uno/uno-docs-intro) for more details.

:::note
We currently do not support event collector for Uno Platform. This is planned for a future release.
:::

## Setup
1. Install <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Uno" showLabel={true} /> to your project.
2. In your `App.xaml.cs` file, add the following:
    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseUno());
    ```
3. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would.

## Middleware Support

The Mediator Uno Platform extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseUno`.
