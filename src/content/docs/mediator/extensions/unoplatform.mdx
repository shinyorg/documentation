Uno Platform is a cross-platform framework for building single-codebase applications for WebAssembly, iOS, Android, and Windows.
This innovative platform has become a powerhouse in the .NET ecosystem.  With Uno + Mediator, you can now take advantage of all our offline, persistent cache, and other app building
middleware

:::note
We currently do not support event collector in Uno.  This is planned for a future release.
:::

## Setup
1. Install <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Uno" showLabel={true} /> to your project.
2. In your App.xaml.cs file, add the following:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UseUno());
```
3. Start making calls to the mediator as you normally would 

## Middleware Support

The Mediator MAUI extension comes with a lot of preinstalled default middleware (that you can opt out of).  If you choose to opt-out of this middleware being installed,
simply pass false to the first argument in `UseUno`

* [Offline](/mediator/middleware/offline)
* [Replay Stream](/mediator/middleware/replay)
* [Persistent Caching](/mediator/middleware/caching)
