:::danger
New .NET mobile developers, Dapper does not work on iOS or Android due to complexities around reflection. This extension is designed for server-side .NET applications.

:::warning
Requires a 'mature' dependency injection container.  Please refer to [Advanced](./advanced) for more information

<NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.DapperRequests" label="Shiny.Mediator.DapperRequests" />

Dapper extensions are designed to make it easier to work with [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) and Shiny Mediator.  Like our [HTTP](./http) extensions, we wanted to reduce
boilerplate while exposing all of the mediator middleware while still keeping the full power of Dapper available.  To accomplish this, we've also
added [InterpolatedSql](https://github.com/Drizin/InterpolatedSql) to make it easier to work with SQL strings.


## Setup
<Steps>
1. Install the <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.DapperRequests" label="Shiny.Mediator.DapperRequests" /> package
2. Register in your Shiny Mediator startup call
    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(cfg =>
    {
        // just like dapper, you just have to supply an ADO.NET connection
        cfg.AddDapper<SqliteConnection>("your connection string");
    });
    ```
3. Start making calls as shown below
</Steps>

## How to use it

Unlike other extensions, Dapper doesn't require you create any handlers or contracts, simply make one of the 3 available contract calls

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // injected

var email = "allan%";

// get a single row
User? result = await mediator.Request(new DapperFirstQuery<User>(
    $"select * from \"Users\" where \"Email\" like {email}"
));

// execute multiple rows
IEnumerable<User> results = await mediator.Request(new DapperQuery<User>(
    $"select * from \"Users\" where \"Email\" like {email}"
));

// execute scalars/counts
object? count = await mediator.Request(new DapperScalar(
    $"select count(*) from \"Users\" where \"Email\" like {email}"
));
```

:::note
Notice the usage of formatted strings.  This query becomes a parameterized query and is safe from SQL injection due to the power of [InterpolatedSql](https://github.com/Drizin/InterpolatedSql)

## Dynamic Connections

There will be cases where you may need to connect to different databases that may even be different platforms.  The initial setup shown above is designed for a single database on a single platform.  
You didn't think we would lock you in like that though did you?

We have a simple answer to accomplish this.

```csharp
public class MyConnectionProvider : Shiny.Mediator.DapperRequests.IConnectionProvider
{
    public IDbConnection Create<TRequest>(TRequest request)
    {
        // from here, the sky is the limit for how you want to implement this.  You get access to see the request object so you can adjust per type
        return new SqliteConnection("your connection string");
    }
}

```

Now, just register this in your startup

    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.AddDapper<MyConnectionProvider>();
    });
    ```
