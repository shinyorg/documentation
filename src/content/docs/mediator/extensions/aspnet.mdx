:::note
Unlike middleware, extensions like ASPNET don't have a piece of code you really have to register.  There is no request handler or middleware registered for the ASP.NET extension.
:::

## Setup
Shiny Mediator now can map up your request handlers to ASP.NET Core endpoints using the minimal API.  This
saves you the effort of implementing the following boilerplate over and over and over again

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/MyResultHandler", async (IMediator mediator, MyRequest request, CancellationToken ct) =>
{
    return await mediator.Request(request, ct);
});
```

The only thing that changes in this setup is the http method type, request type, and route.  Now, all you have to do is 
following;

<Steps>
1. Install Shiny.Mediator.AspNet <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.AspNet" showLabel={true} /> to your ASP.NET Core project.

2. On your request handler (void or result based), add `[MediatorHttpPost("OperationId", "MyRoute")]` or `[MediatorHttpPut("OperationId", "MyRoute")]` (GET & DELETE attributes also available) attribute to the handler.

   ```csharp
   [MediatorScoped] // if you want this registration through source gen (best practice) - you can only used scoped for handlers in ASPNET
   [MediatorHttpGroup("/routes", RequiresAuthorization = true)]
   public class MyHandler : IRequestHandler<MyRequest, MyResult>
   {
       [MediatorHttpPost("MyOperation", "/my")] // creates a route with the operationId of "MyOperation" and a route of "/routes/my"
       public async Task<MyResult> Handle(MyRequest request, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
       {
           return new MyResult();
       }
   }
   ```
   :::note
   `MediatorHttpGroup` is optional and allows you to group your handlers under a common route prefix.  This is useful for versioning or grouping related endpoints.
   The attribute can also be used on multiple classes, but the group is only emitted once.
   :::

3. In your host startup, add the following after your build your app.  Here is a full-ish sample

   ```csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   // Use mediator registry method if using [MediatorScoped] attributes to register your handlers
   builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddMediatorRegistry()); 

   // OR ADD YOUR HANDLER(S) manually
   services.AddScopeAsImplementedInterfaces<MyHandler>();


   var app = builder.Build();
   
   // ADD REGISTERED HANDLERS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HTTP ENDPOINTS
   app.MapGeneratedMediatorEndpoints());
   app.Run();
   ```

</Steps>

Here is a list of all the properties supported by the Http attributes

```csharp
public class MediatorHttpAttribute(string operationId, string uriTemplate, HttpMethod httpMethod) : Attribute
{
    public string OperationId => operationId;
    public string UriTemplate => uriTemplate;
    public HttpMethod Method => httpMethod;
    
    public bool RequiresAuthorization { get; set; }
    public string[]? AuthorizationPolicies { get; set; }
    public string? DisplayName { get; set; }
    public string? GroupName { get; set; }
    public string[]? Tags { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public string? Summary { get; set; }
    public bool UseOpenApi { get; set; } = true;
    public string? CachePolicy { get; set; }
    public string? CorsPolicy { get; set; }
    public bool ExcludeFromDescription { get; set; }
    public string? RateLimitingPolicy { get; set; }
    public bool AllowAnonymous { get; set; }
}
```

:::warning
MediatorHttpGet & MediatorHttpDelete parameters can only be set on the route or querystring.  All http handlers are automatically generated to map against a scoped mediator handler
:::

## Minimal API Registration

Minimal API allows you some fine grained control that attribute registration may restrict as it returns the standard `RouteHandleBuilder` object that
ASP.NET registration returns

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Use mediator registry method if using [MediatorScoped] attributes to register your handlers
builder.Services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddMediatorRegistry());
var app = builder.Build();

// fluent registration can be mixed with the attribute registration
app.MapMediatorGet<MappedRequest, string>("/mapped").WithOpenApi();

app.Run();
```

:::note
Handlers can only be marked as scoped when using the ASPNET extension due to the nature of web requests.
:::

## Server Sent Events

Server Sent Events (SSE) allow you to stream data from the server to the client over HTTP.  Shiny Mediator now supports sending stream requests as SSE endpoints.

This feature comes in two flavours

### Stream Requests

We take your standard stream request handlers and allow you to send them as SSE endpoints.  Here is an example of a stream request to SSE.

```csharp
app.MapGet(
    "/sse",
    (
        [FromServices] IMediator mediator,
        [FromServices] IHttpContextAccessor context, // remember to call services.AddHttpContextAccessor() in your startup
        [AsParameters] TickerStreamRequest request // a stream request
    ) => mediator.RequestServerSentEvents(request, context)
).ExcludeFromDescription();
```


### Event Streams

Maybe you want to listen for a specific event publication through mediator.  This easy extension method allows you to do just that.

```csharp
public class MyEvent : IEvent;

app.MapGet(
    "/subscribe",
    (
        [FromServices] IMediator mediator,
        [FromServices] IHttpContextAccessor context // remember to call services.AddHttpContextAccessor() in your startup
    ) => mediator.EventStreamToServerSentEvents<MyEvent>(context)
).ExcludeFromDescription();
```
