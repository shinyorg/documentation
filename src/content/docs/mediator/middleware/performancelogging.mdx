:::note
Performance logging middleware is applied to [Commands](/mediator/commands) and [Requests](/mediator/requests)
:::

Ever wanted to track and log how long your requests take to process?  Maybe even have an error logged if a call is passing
a certain threshold? The `PerformanceLogging` middleware is designed to help you with this.

Internally, the middleware will log the time it takes to process a request to your logging setup.  If the error threshold is passed, it
will log an error otherwise it will log to Debug.

:::warning
We recommend focusing timed logging on your most critical requests.  Logging every request can be a performance hit.
:::

## Setup

In your host startup, add the following to your mediator configuration:

```csharp 
services.AddShinyMediator(cfg => cfg.UsePerformanceLogging());
```

:::note
Performance logging middleware is installed by the default mediator setup
:::

## Configuration

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "PerformanceLogging": {
            "My.Contracts.*": {
                "ErrorThresholdMilliseconds": 1000
            }
        }
    }
}
```
