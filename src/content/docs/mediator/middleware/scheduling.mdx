Commands are often designed to tell a system to do something.  You don't need a response other than "did it crash".  Commands offer additional capabilities such as deferred execution/scheduling and it is super simple to add!

:::note
Command scheduling middleware only applies to [Commands](/mediator/commands)

## MediatorContext Command Scheduling

<Steps>
1. Create a command that implements `ICommand` like normal (part of Shiny.Mediator.Contracts)
    ```csharp
    public class MyScheduledCommand : ICommand;
    ```

2. Create a standard command handler.  Notice there is nothing special about this handler.
    ```csharp
    public class MyScheduledCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<MyScheduledCommand>
    {
        public async Task Handle(MyScheduledCommand command, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            // do something with the command
        }
    }
    ```
3. Register the handler and enable command scheduling
    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(x => 
    {
        x.AddCommandScheduler<MyCommandScheduler>();
        // ... command registration left out for brevity
    });
    ```
3. When calling the IMediator.Send method, we add an additional parameter to the context
    ```csharp
    IMediator mediator; // dependency inject like normal
    await mediator.Send(
        new MySchedule(), 
        CancellationToken.None,
        ctx => ctx.SetCommandSchedule(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddMinutes(10))
    );
    ```
</Steps>

## Contract Scheduling

<Steps>
1. Create a command that implements `IScheduledCommand` (part of Shiny.Mediator.Contracts)
    ```csharp
    public class MyScheduledCommand : IScheduledCommand
    {
        public DateTime DueAt { get; set; }
    }
    ```

2. Create a standard command handler.  Notice there is nothing special about this handler.
    ```csharp
    public class MyScheduledCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<MyScheduledCommand>
    {
        public async Task Handle(MyScheduledCommand command, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            // do something with the command
        }
    }
    ```

3. Follow all the steps to register the handler shown in [Commands](/mediator/commands)
4. Register the command scheduling middleware in your AddShinyMediator registration
    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddInMemoryCommandScheduling());
    ```

5. Now, sends your command
    ```csharp
    IMediator mediator;
    await mediator.Send(new MyScheduledCommand
    {
        DueAt = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5)
    });
    ```

    :::note
    The command will go through all of the normal middleware but will when scheduled to run, it will go directly to your command handler 
    :::

</Steps>

## Custom Scheduling

In-Memory is fine for getting up and running.  There are likely instances where you want this to survive across application restarts.  We currently only offer an in-memory provider, but this is easily extendable to you now.


<Steps>
1. Create a command scheduler by impleming `Shiny.Mediator.ICommandScheduler` (part of Shiny.Mediator)
    ```csharp
    public class MyCommandScheduler : ICommandScheduler
    {
        public Task Schedule(IMediatorContext context, DateTimeOffset dueAt, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // IMediatorContext contains all of the "stuff" you need
            mediator.Message; // object of your mediator contract
            mediator.MessageHandler; // the handler to call - HOWEVER: consider using context.Send

            // It is not recommended you use the cancellation token before STORING whatever data here as this is related to the WRITING of the call, NOT the run of the scheduled command
        }
    }
    ```
    
2. Now register during your AddShinyMediator registration
    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddCommandScheduler<MyCommandScheduler>());
    ```

3. Now, when you send a command that implements `IScheduledCommand`, it will go through your scheduler
    ```csharp
    IMediator mediator;
    await mediator.Send(new MyScheduledCommand
    {
        DueAt = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5)
    });
    ```
</Steps>

:::note
You can only have one command scheduler registered
