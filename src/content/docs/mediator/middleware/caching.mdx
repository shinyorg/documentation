import NugetBadge from '/src/components/NugetBadge.tsx';

:::note
Caching middleware is applied only to [Requests](/mediator/requests)

<NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Caching.MicrosoftMemoryCache" showLabel={true} />

Our caching provider is built on top of [Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/caching)
Caching is insanely easy with request handlers in Shiny Mediator.

:::note
Caching uses [Request Keys](/mediator/requestkeys) to determine the key of a request cached item 
:::

<Steps>
1. Install Shiny.Mediator.Caching.MicrosoftMemoryCache <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Mediator.Caching.MicrosoftMemoryCache" showLabel={true} /> to your project.

2. Create your request handler - you can mark Cache here with the attribute or you can use [Configuration](./).

   ```csharp
   [Cache(AbsoluteExpirationSeconds = 60, SlidingExpirationSeconds = 30)]
   public class MyHandler : IRequestHandler<MyRequest, MyResult>
   {
       public async Task<MyResult> Handle(MyRequest request, RequestContext<MyRequest> context, CancellationToken ct)
       {
           return new MyResult();
       }
   }
   ```

3. In your host startup, with the AddShinyMediator call, add the following:

   ```csharp
   services.AddShinyMediator(x => x..AddMemoryCaching(y =>
   {
        y.ExpirationScanFrequency = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
   }));
   ```

4. That's it!  Your handler will now cache for 60 seconds with a sliding expiration of 30 seconds.
</Steps>

### Setting Cache Config on the Context

Sometimes, a very specific call from a very specific location may have a need to set the cache config from a call.  You can do
this through the IMediatorContext headers

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // inject this
var response = await mediator.Request(new MyRequest(), CancellationToken.None, ctx => ctx.SetCacheConfig(new CacheItemConfig
{
    AbsoluteExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60),
    SlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
}));
```

### Forcing Cache Refresh

You can add the ICacheControl to your contract to control cache directly at the point of call.

ForceRefresh allows an easy way to bypass cache and SetEntry allows you to set cache entry properties.

```csharp
IMediator mediator; // inject this
var response = await mediator.Request(new MyRequest(), CancellationToken.None, ctx => ctx.ForceCacheRefresh());
response.Result // won't be from cache

var cacheInfo = response.Context.Cache();
cacheInfo.IsHit // will be false
```

### Configuration

We recommend configuring cache through Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.  Read [Configuration](./) for more information.

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "Cache": {
            "My.Namespace.MyHandler": {
                "Priority": "High",
                "AbsoluteExpirationSeconds": 60,
                "SlidingExpirationSeconds": 30
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use Caching. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

## Persistent Cache

Persistent cache is built into our [MAUI](/mediator/extensions/maui) and [Uno Platform](/mediator/extensions/unoplatform) extensions.  It uses the file system to store cache data.  This allows cache to survive
across application restarts.  It works identical to the memory cache, but you can specify a different cache provider.

```csharp
services.AddShinyMediator(x => 
{
    x.AddMauiPersistentCache();

    // OR
    x.AddUnoPersistentCache(); 
});

```

It works identical to the memory cache, but stores to the filesystem instead.  This is great for combining with things like Shiny Background Jobs to keep your cache fresh.

## Custom Cache Providers

Custom caching is now easy to accomplish inside Shiny.Mediator.  Your cache provider can also make use of all the same benefits/configuration as already shown.


<Steps>

1. Implement your custom provider `Shiny.Mediator.Caching.ICacheProvider` located in the Shiny.Mediator package.
   ```csharp 
   public interface ICacheService
   {
        Task<CacheEntry<T>?> GetOrCreate<T>(
            string key, 
            Func<Task<T>> factory,
            CacheItemConfig? config = null
        );
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Manually insert or overwrite an item in cache
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="key"></param>
        /// <param name="value"></param>
        /// <param name="config"></param>
        Task<CacaheEntry<T>> Set<T>(
            string key, 
            T value, 
            CacheItemConfig? config = null
        );


        /// <summary>
        /// Retrieves a cached value, null if not found
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="key"></param>
        /// <typeparam name="T"></typeparam>
        /// <returns></returns>
        Task<CacheEntry<T>?> Get<T>(string key);

        /// <summary>
        /// Removes a specific cache item
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="key"></param>
        Task Remove(string key);
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Clears cache keys starting with prefix
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="prefix"></param>
        Task RemoveByPrefix(string prefix);

        /// <summary>
        /// Clears all cache
        /// </summary>
        Task Clear();
   }
   ```

2. Now register it with Shiny.Mediator
    ```csharp
    services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddCaching<MyCustomCacheService>());
    ```

    :::warning
    You can only have 1 cache provider registered at a time for our middleware.  If you need something more custom, you'll need to create your own middleware to handle it.
    :::

</Steps>


## Contexts & 'Did my data come from cache'?

There is often times that you want to know IF your data came from cache, but also WHEN it was stored.  This is easy to accomplish using
the `IMediatorContext` interface.  This interface is populated with tons of extra data during your mediator calls including offline data.

There is an extension method called `IMediatorContext.Cache` - if this value is returned as null, the data is "fresh", otherwise, it contains info about
when the data was stored.

```csharp
IMediator mediator;
var response = mediator.Request(new MyRequest());

response.Result // the actual data
var cache = response.Context.Cache();

if (!cache.IsHit) 
{
    // ... data is direct from source
}
else 
{
    // data is from offline store
    cache.Timestamp // when the data was stored
    cache.RequestKey // the key used to store the data
}
```
