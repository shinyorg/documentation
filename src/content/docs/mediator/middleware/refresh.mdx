:::note
Refresh timer middleware is applied only to [Streams](/mediator/streams)
:::

There are scenarios where you want to have data requests be called every so often. The `RefreshTimer` middleware is designed to help you with this.


## Attribute Setup
```csharp
public class MyRequest : IStreamRequest<string>;

[RefreshTimer(3000)] // every 3 seconds
public class MyStreamRequestHandler : IStreamRequestHandler<MyRequest, string>
{
    public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> Handle(MyRequest request, IMediatorContext context, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        yield return DateTimeOffset.Now.ToString("h:mm:ss tt");
    }
} 

```
and now in your code, you can simply call the mediator to get the stream and await foreach

```csharp
```csharp
var stream = mediator.Request(new MyRequest());
await foreach (var item in stream)
{
    // this code will be called every 3 seconds
} 
```

## Configuration

Much like other middleware, you can use the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.  

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "TimerRefresh": {
            "MyNamespace.MyStreamHandler": {
                "IntervalSeconds": 20
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use TimerRefresh. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

Refresh timer middleware is installed by the main Shiny.Mediator package by default
