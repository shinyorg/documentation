title: User Error Notification Handling
---
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import NugetBadge from '/src/components/NugetBadge.tsx';

:::note
User notification middleware is applied to [Commands](../commands) and [Requests](../requests)
:::

User notification exception handling is great for scenarios where the user initiates an action, but an issue occurs
such as the network failing, data issues, etc.  This middleware does the standard try/execute/catch/log & notify user
that something went wrong

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with Maui & Blazor
:::

## Usage

To use it on with your request handlers, simply configured the `UserErrorNotifications` section in your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "UserErrorNotifications": {
            "My.Contracts.*": {
                "*": {
                    "Title": "ERROR",
                    "Message" : "Failed to do something"
                },
                "fr-CA": {
                    "Title": "ERREUR",
                    "Message" : "Ã‰chec de faire quelque chose"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use user error notifications. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

:::note
The `*` is a wildcard for the default/fallback values.  You can also specify a specific handler or language
