title: Offline Availability

:::note
Offline middleware is applied only to [Requests](/mediator/requests)
:::

* Have you ever found a case where you have a cache, but it just doesn't care about the user's current network status?  
* Have you ever wanted to ensure data is available for your app the next time it launches, but the user is disconnected?

When you are building a mobile app, you need to consider offline availability.  This is especially true for apps that
are used in the field or in areas where network connectivity is spotty.  

:::note
Offline availability is installed by default with the UseMaui setup.

The offline availability middleware is used as part of the default middleware installed by Shiny.Mediator.Maui OR Shiny.Mediator.Blazor.  Like most
other middleware, you simply need to mark your IRequestHandler.Handle method(s) with the attribute `[Offline]` or using the Configuration system.

Obviously, offline only works for request handlers with a return value.

Fine grained control over offline data is available via [Request Keys](/mediator/requestkeys)
:::

:::warning
Offline should not be considered a "cache".  If online connectivity is detected, the offline middleware will keep making calls to your handler.  Consider using the (Caching Middleware)[./caching] if you are
looking for a performance based cache setup
:::

## Request Handler Example

```csharp
public class MyRequestHandler : IRequestHandler<MyRequest, IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>>
{
    [OfflineAvailable]
    public async Task<IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>> Handle(MyRequest request, IMediatorContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // each return will overwrite the previous return value
    }
}
```

:::note
Above is configured with the `OfflineAvailableAttribute`.  You can also configure the Microsoft Extensions Configuration using the following:

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "Offline": {
            "MyNamespace.SomeHttpRequest": true
        }
    }
}
```

For more info about configuration, see [Middleware Configuration](./)
:::

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use Offline. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

## Controlling HOW the offline data is stored

Often, there are times you want to store data based on the parameter arguments within your request.  Trying to build these keys for you
can be a bit tricky, so we have a simple interface to help you out instead.

The offline middleware looks at your IRequest implementation.  You can also implement the `IRequestKey` interface which is part
of the Shiny.Mediator.Contracts library.  This allows you to 'build' a key from possible arguments in your request object.

Example
```csharp
public record MyRequest(string Arg1, int Arg2) : IRequest<IReadOnlyList<MyThingData>>, IRequestKey
{
    public string GetKey() => $"{this.Arg1}-{this.Arg2}";
}
```

## Contexts & 'Did my data come from offline storage'?

There is often times that you want to know IF your data came from an offline store, but also WHEN it was stored.  This is easy to accomplish using
the `IMediatorContext` interface.  This interface is populated with tons of extra data during your mediator calls including offline data.

There is an extension method called `IMediatorContext.Offline` - if this value is returned as null, the data is "fresh", otherwise, it contains info about
when the data was stored.

```csharp
IMediator mediator;
var response = mediator.Request(new MyRequest());

response.Result // the actual data
var offline = response.Context.Offline();

if (offline == null) 
{
    // ... data is direct from source
}
else 
{
    // data is from offline store
    offline.Timestamp // when the data was stored
    offline.RequestKey // the key used to store the data
}
```
