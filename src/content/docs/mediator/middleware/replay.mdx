:::note
Refresh timer middleware is applied only to [Streams](/mediator/streams)

There are occasions where you need to make a large or long duration network call, what if you could return the previous results 
while the current network call is in progress?  What if you don't have a network connection and the method should just "wait" until it does?
The `Replay` middleware is designed to help you with this.

Replay is designed to work with cache and/or offline availability services if they are registered with your container.

:::note
Replay can also handle offline scenarios and will "wait" until the network is available
:::

## Setup

So here we have a standard HTTP call on our streaming async enumerable protocol.  Nothing special here, but once we turn on the `Replay` middleware, we can return the previous results while the current network call is in progress.

```csharp
public class MyRequest : IStreamRequest<string>;

public class MyStreamRequestHandler : IStreamRequestHandler<MyRequest, SomeResponse>
{
    public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> Handle(MyRequest request, IMediatorContext context, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        ... some long http call
    }
} 
```

### In Your Code

At first, you'll see there is nothing special, but the cool part here is that the async enumerable will "pump" twice.  The first time for the previous results
(if the call has previous been made) and the second time with the new response from your long call.

```csharp
var stream = mediator.Request(new MyRequest());
await foreach (var item in stream)
{
    MyBinding = item; // will passthrough here twice
} 
```


## Configuration

Much like other middleware, you can use the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.  

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "ReplayStream": {
            "MyNamespace.MyStreamHandler": true
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use ReplayStream. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with `Shiny.Mediator.Maui` or `Shiny.Mediator.Blazor`
