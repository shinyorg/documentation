## Exception Handling

Exception handling across all handler types is easier than ever with a exception handler.  Global exception handling is nothing more than 
middleware installing middleware for all handler types, but providing one interface to rule them.  Best of all, you don't have to use 1 exception handler
to cover all cases.  You can register multiple and just return true if your handler managed the exception.

```csharp
public class MyExceptionHandler : Shiny.Mediator.IExceptionHandler
{
    public Task<bool> Handle(Exception ex, EventContext context)
    {
        // do something
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}

// can be registered as scoped or singleton
services.AddShinyMediator(x => x.AddExceptionHandler<MyExceptionHandler>());
```

:::warn
Global Exception Handling middleware is added automatically by the library
This middleware does not apply to [Streams](/mediator/streams) at this time
:::

:::note
The ability to skip exception handling in any call is easy.  Just add the following header to any Send/Request/Publish call

```csharp
IMediator medidator; //injected
mediator.Send(new MyRequest(), CancellationToken.None, Headers.BypassExceptionHandling);
```

## Prevent Event Exceptions

Events can throw exceptions.  You can trap them at a global level by awaiting the Publish call.  However, there may be cases
where you may want other events to complete and not be blocked by one misbehaving piece of code.  Thus, we have middleware to help
deal with this in a very simple/straight forward manor.  

This middleware does nothing more than log an error and `moves on`.  This is applied to all event handlers and does not require any attributes
or configuration like other middleware

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with Shiny.Mediator

## User Notification Exception Handling
:::note
User notification middleware is applied to [Commands](/mediator/commands) and [Requests](/mediator/requests)
:::

User notification exception handling is great for scenarios where the user initiates an action, but an issue occurs
such as the network failing, data issues, etc.  This middleware does the standard try/execute/catch/log & notify user
that something went wrong

:::note
This middleware is installed by default with Maui & Blazor

## Usage

To use it on with your request handlers, simply configured the `UserErrorNotifications` section in your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
    "Mediator": {
        "UserErrorNotifications": {
            "My.Contracts.*": {
                "*": {
                    "Title": "ERROR",
                    "Message" : "Failed to do something"
                },
                "fr-CA": {
                    "Title": "ERREUR",
                    "Message" : "Ã‰chec de faire quelque chose"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
Configuration does allow you to specify wildcard/globs `*` to specify all handlers in a namespace use user error notifications. 
WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THIS.  This feature is something you want to be very explicit about.
:::


:::note
The `*` is a wildcard for the default/fallback values.  You can also specify a specific handler or language
