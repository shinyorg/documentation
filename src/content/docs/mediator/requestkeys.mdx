title: Request Keys
---
Request keys can in most ways be called a 'Cache key'.  Let's say you want to cache an HTTP request, but that request has filters and varying types of parameters.
Obviously, you want to have different caches for these varying parameters.  Request keys gives you the ability to take control of HOW these keys are built right from your
contract calls.

Request keys are currently used by the following middleware:
- [Caching](/mediator/middleware/caching)
- [Offline](/mediator/middleware/offline)
- [Stream Replays](/mediator/middleware/replay)

:::note
The IRequestKey interface is found in the Shiny.Mediator.Contracts nuget which is referenced by ALL Shiny.Mediator
:::

Let's take a look at a sample request contract.

```csharp

public record MyRequest(string Id, string Category) : IRequest<MyResult>, IRequestKey
{
    // WARNING: we do not alter your key in anyway, so be sure to make it unique by adding things like the type
    public string GetRequestKey() => $"MyRequest-{Id}-{Category}";
}
public record MyResult;
```

:::danger
Careful when you create a key based on dates or other dynamic values - you may end up with a lot of entries with a ton of misses.
