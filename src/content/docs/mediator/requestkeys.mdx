title: Request Keys
---
Request keys can in most ways be called a 'Cache key'.  Let's say you want to cache an HTTP request, but that request has filters and varying types of parameters.
Obviously, you want to have different caches for these varying parameters.  Request keys gives you the ability to take control of HOW these keys are built right from your
contract calls.

Request keys are currently used by the following middleware:
- [Caching](/mediator/middleware/caching)
- [Offline](/mediator/middleware/offline)
- [Stream Replays](/mediator/middleware/replay)

:::note
The IRequestKey interface is found in the Shiny.Mediator.Contracts nuget which is referenced by ALL Shiny.Mediator
:::

Let's take a look at a sample request contract.

```csharp

public record MyRequest(string Id, string Category) : IRequest<MyResult>, IRequestKey
{
    // WARNING: we do not alter your key in anyway, so be sure to make it unique by adding things like the type
    public string GetRequestKey() => $"MyRequest-{Id}-{Category}";
}
public record MyResult;
```

:::danger
Careful when you create a key based on dates or other dynamic values - you may end up with a lot of entries with a ton of misses.

### Contract Key Provider
Starting with Shiny Mediator 4.9, we introduced the `IContractKeyProvider` interface. This allows you to provide a custom way of generating request keys without having to implement `IRequestKey` on every contract.

You can implement this interface to pull values from configuration, source generation, or any other method you prefer. The default implementation uses reflection to maintain backwards compatibility, but you can create your own provider for more advanced scenarios.

```csharp
public class CustomContractKeyProvider : IContractKeyProvider
{
    public string GetContractKey(object key)
    {
        return "Custom Key"; // careful to make sure this doesn't conflict here
    }
}

:::danger
Our `DefaultContractKeyProvider` uses reflection (currently) to build out a key if IRequestKey is not implemented.  It does do a good job ensuring the key built is unique for the contract.  You key provider will need to also ensure appropriate uniqueness
:::

### Source Generated Contract Keys

Implementing code is so "old school".  We wanted to make it easy to implement contract keys without having to write a ton of code.  Source generators to the rescue!  In our sample shown below, it essentially generates
all of the IRequestKey logic, checks for null, ToStings values with format strings, etc saving you time!

```csharp

[Shiny.Mediator.ContractKey("MyRequest_{IntValue}_{Timestamp:MMM_dd_yyyy}_{FullIntValue}")]
public partial class MyRequest : Shiny.Mediator.IRequest<MyResult> 
{
    public double NotUsed { get; set; }  // not used because it is not used within the key
    public int? IntValue { get; set; }
    public int FullIntValue { get; set; }

    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set;}
}
```

1. Make the class (or record) partial or the source generator will error
2. Mark your class/record with the `[ContractKey]` attribute
3. Optional: specify the format of the key.  Leaving the format blank will assume you want to use all properties within the class


:::note
* String formats are supported just like string literals
* If the value of a property in the key is null, that portion of the key is replaced with blank
