<Card title="Shiny Client" icon="rocket">
    A cross-platform framework for iOS and Android that brings background services, device hardware, and platform APIs into your .NET app through a clean, dependency-injected architecture. Stop wrestling with platform quirks — Shiny handles the hard parts so you can focus on your app.

    **Includes:** Bluetooth LE (Client & Host), Background Jobs, Local & Push Notifications, HTTP Transfers, GPS & Geofencing, Beacons, and more.

    Get started fast with our templates: <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Templates" client:load />

    > dotnet new install Shiny.Templates

</Card>

<Card title="Mediator" icon="puzzle">
    A mediator pattern implementation built for **all** .NET apps — mobile, desktop, and server. Source-generated, AOT-ready, and packed with middleware that lets you add offline support, caching, validation, resiliency, and more with a single attribute.

    Decouple your code, shrink your constructors, and eliminate boilerplate. Works seamlessly with MAUI, Blazor, Uno Platform, ASP.NET Core, Prism, and Dapper.

</Card>

<Card title="Aspire" icon="cloud-download">
    First-class .NET Aspire integrations for building distributed applications with best-practice defaults.

    **Orleans** — Simplified Orleans hosting for Aspire with streamlined AppHost configuration, Silo setup, and client wiring. Get a fully orchestrated Orleans cluster running in your Aspire app with minimal code.

![Speedy Dock](/images/sponsors/speedydock-dark.png)
SpeedyDock is an essential application for drystack marinas, boat clubs, and their clientele, streamlining the process of scheduling and monitoring boat launch requests, reservations, and additional services. It offers a user-friendly alternative to the frequent calls customers used to make, enabling electronic scheduling around the clock. Since its initial release in 2016, SpeedyDock has been accessible across iOS, Android, and web platforms, seamlessly integrating Xamarin and Shiny to manage native functionalities.

A core component of SpeedyDock's efficiency is Shiny. It powers the app's capability to work with permissions requests, local notifications, geofencing, and Firebase push, ensuring customers are consistently informed about their request statuses. For marina operators, these timely notifications are instrumental in enhancing service quality when customers set foot on the premises. Shiny has expertly bridged the gap between iOS and Android, offering a structured way to organize and share code, which, in the absence of such a tool, would be intricate due to variances across platforms and different OS versions. It has streamlined our development process for new features and minimized the edge case bugs typically associated with varying Android versions.

Shiny isn't just a tool for SpeedyDock; it's a cornerstone of our mobile app development. Its integration has empowered us to deliver a top-tier app with a native experience. Looking ahead, we're eager to continue our journey with Shiny, leveraging its capabilities for upcoming projects and refining the SpeedyDock experience. It has undeniably been a key factor in our app's success story.
